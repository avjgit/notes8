01 Basics of MVC and the Moving Parts

    Sites ************************** Services **************
    WebForms *** WebPages *** SinglePageApps *** SignalR ***
                              MVC *** WebApi *** 
    ASP.NET ************************************************


    Request comes to a controller - or, concrete - METHOD ON A CLASS. Not a file.

    Controller retrieves a model and "does stuff" - 
    in end, creates a view and provides data for it.

    View is send as response.

    Model has data.
    Controller has logic and does not know about HTML.
    View has HTML and has no logic.

    WebForms downsides: 
        * page lifecycle (master, page, control)
        * viewstate

    MVC
        structure from the start
        testability (safety for future code changes)
